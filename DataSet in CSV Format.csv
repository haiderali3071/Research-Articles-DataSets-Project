Such disruption increases the    execution time and in some cases restrain the mobile devices from    getting execution results from the cloud. This research work analyzes    the impact of user mobility on the execution of cloud-based mobile    applications. We propose a Process State Synchronization (PSS)based    execution management to solve the aforementioned problem. We    analytically compute a sufficient condition on synchronization interval    that ensure reduction in mobile application execution time under PSS in    case of disconnection. Similarly, we compute the upper bound on    synchronization interval whereby a larger synchronization interval did    not result in significant benefits in terms of execution time for the    mobile application. The analytical results were confirmed by the sample    implementation of PSS with the computed synchronization intervals.    Moreover, we also compare the performance of proposed solution with the    state-of-the-art solutions. The results show that the PSS-based    execution outperforms the other contemporary solutions. (C) 2018    Elsevier B.V.

The routing    must avoid forwarding packets through segments with low network density    and high scale of network disconnections that may result in packet loss,    delays, and increased communication overhead in route recovery.    Therefore, both traffic and segment status must be considered. This    paper presents real-time intersection-based segment aware routing    (RTISAR), an intersection-based segment aware algorithm for geographic    routing in VANETs. This routing algorithm provides an optimal route for    forwarding the data packets toward their destination by considering the    traffic segment status when choosing the next intersection. RTISAR    presents a new formula for assessing segment status based on    connectivity, density, load segment, and cumulative distance toward the    destination. A verity period mechanism is proposed to denote the    projected period when a network failure is likely to occur in a    particular segment. This mechanism can be calculated for each collector    packet to minimize the frequency of RTISAR execution and to control the    generation of collector packets. As a result, this mechanism minimizes    the communication overhead generated during the segment status    computation process. Simulations are performed to evaluate RTISAR, and    the results are compared with those of intersection-based connectivity    aware routing and traffic flow-oriented routing. The evaluation results    provided evidence that RTISAR outperforms in terms of packet delivery    ratio, packet delivery delay, and communication overhead.}","","{Communication overhead; VANETs; segment aware}","",""

However,    due to the lack of intelligence in the traditional transportation    system, it takes a lot of resources to manually retrieve and locate the    queried objects from a large number of images. In order to solve this    issue, we propose an effective method for query-based object    localization, which uses artificial intelligence techniques to    automatically locate the queried object in complex backgrounds. The    proposed method is termed as Fine-grained and Progressive Attention    Localization Network (FPAN), which uses an image and a queried object as    input to accurately locate the target object in the image. Specifically,    the fine-grained attention module is naturally embedded into each layer    of a convolution neural network (CNN), thereby gradually suppressing the    regions that are irrelevant to the queried object and eventually    focusing attention on the target area. We further employ top-down    attentions fusion algorithm operated by a learnable cascade up-sampling    structure to establish the connection between the attention map and the    exact location of the queried object in the original image. Furthermore,    the FPAN is trained by multi-task learning with box segmentation loss    and cosine loss. At last, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both    queried-based digit localization and object tracking with synthetic and    benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm is    far superior than other algorithms on the synthesis datasets and    outperforms most existing trackers on the OTB and VOT datasets.

To facilitate    the offloading negotiation between the MNO and satellite, we design a    second-price auction mechanism which presents positive allocative    externalities, i.e., other uncooperative beam groups of the satellite    can benefit from the cooperation between BSs and the beam group    performing offloading.

The increasing number of vehicles    has led to challenges in traffic regulation. Vehicle-type detection is    an important research topic that has found various applications in    numerous fields. Its main purpose is to extract the different features    of vehicles from videos or pictures captured by traffic surveillance so    as to identify the types of vehicles, and then provide reference    information for traffic monitoring and control. In this paper, we    propose a step-forward vehicle-detection and -classification method    using a saliency map and the convolutional neural-network (CNN)    technique. Specifically, compressed-sensing (CS) theory is applied to    generate the saliency map to label the vehicles in an image, and the CNN    scheme is then used to classify them. We applied the concept of the    saliency map to search the image for target vehicles: this step is based    on the use of the saliency map to minimize redundant areas. CS was used    to measure the image of interest and obtain its saliency in the    measurement domain. Because the data in the measurement domain are much    smaller than those in the pixel domain, saliency maps can be generated    at a low computation cost and faster speed. Then, based on the saliency    map, we identified the target vehicles and classified them into    different types using the CNN. The experimental results show that our    method is able to speed up the window-calibrating stages of CNN-based    image classification. Moreover, our proposed method has better overall    performance in vehicle-type detection compared with other methods.

In order to    improve flow delivery performance, several modules, such as information    awareness and link prediction modules, are designed in this    software-defined architecture. Taking advantage of the embedded modules,    the controller predicts the link remaining duration for each vehicle    timely by the location and velocity information.

Finally, the simulation scenario is set to a high-speed    vehicle-to-infrastructure (V21) network. The vehicle is a high-speed    train. The roadside infrastructures belong to cellular networks. For    comparison, greedy perimeter stateless routing with lifetime (GPSR-L) is    introduced. The results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms GPSR-L    with an improvement in the successful transmission.

Only data owners and fog devices are    involved when deleting cloud data and validating the deletion of these    data, which makes the protocol practical due to the features of low    latency as well as real-time interaction with fog.

Agentless periodic filesystem    monitors are optimal solutions to protect cloud virtual machines because    of the secure and low-overhead features. However, most of the periodic    monitors usually scan all of the virtual machine filesystem or protected    files in every scanning poll, so lots of secure files are scanned again    and again even though they are not corrupted. In this paper, we propose    a novel agentless periodic filesystem monitor framework for virtual    machines with different image formats to improve the performance of    agentless periodic monitors. Our core idea is to minimize the scope of    the scanning files in both file integrity checking and virus detection.    In our monitor, if a file is considered secure, it will not be scanned    when it has not been modified. Since our monitor only scans the newly    created and modified files, it can check fewer files than other    filesystem monitors. To that end, we propose two monitor methods for    different types of virtual machine disks to reduce the number of    scanning files. For virtual machine with single disk image, we hook the    backend driver to capture the disk modification information. For virtual    machine with multiple copy-on-write images, we leverage the    copy-on-write feature of QCOW2 images to achieve the disk modification    analysis. In addition, our system can restore and remove the corrupted    files.
